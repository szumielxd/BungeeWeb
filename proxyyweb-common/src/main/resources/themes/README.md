BungeeWeb allows you to specify your own custom themes for the web
interface, meaning that you can inject your own CSS. This directory is
where you place the CSS files that you wish to inject.

It should be noted that your custom CSS will be added alongside the
default CSS. The CSS file will NOT replace the base CSS file.

Once you have placed your CSS file in this directory, you can change the
'theme' option in BungeeWeb's config.yml to the name of the file,
excluding the file extension.

For example, if I wanted to create a theme called 'red', I would place my
file in this directory named 'red.css', and I would set 'theme' to 'red'.
